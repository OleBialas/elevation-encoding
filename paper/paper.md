# Abstract (250 words maximum, including citations)
Within the scope of this thesis, we conducted two
experiments to investigate the cortical encoding of sound source elevation
using electroencephalography (EEG) while subjects were engaged in a local-
ization task. The results indicate that the human cortex represents sound
source elevation in a linear population rate code and that this neural repre-
sentation is predictive of localization accuracy. This is, to our knowledge, the

## Motivation

### Sound localization is an interesting case of perceptual computation
Unlike in the visual system, where ganglion cells in the retina provide
a topographic representation of sensory input, hair cells in the cochlea
respond to the frequency of sounds waves, providing a tonotopic representa-
tion of sensory input. Since a sound’s position is not represented on the level
of the sensory epithelium, it must be computed by the auditory system. This
computation, which happens at a rapid pace and usually without us being
aware of it, makes sound localization an interesting model for studying how
the brain processes and integrates information for perception.

### Elevation is where our understanding is lacking the most
Today we have a good understanding of the sound localization cues which determine our auditory
sense of direction. Based on these cues, we can determine a sound source’s
azimuth and elevation, which deﬁne a point’s location in a spherical coor-
dinate system. We also have a pretty detailed picture of the different neu-
ral circuits implemented in the brainstem, extracting localization cues from
auditory input and integrating them into a representation of space. How-
ever, knowledge about the encoding of auditory space becomes increasingly
scarce as we ascend the auditory pathway to the cortex, especially what con-
cerns sound source elevation.

### Encoding of elevation has previously not been shown in EEG
While several studies investigated the ﬁring patterns of single neurons in response to changes in sound source elevation,
they do not provide an explanation for the code that represents elevation
on a population level. A recent study used functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) to observe the cortical encoding of sound source elevation.
However, fMRI does not measure neural activity but associated changes in
blood oxygenation, and it also prohibits the employment of realistic sound
localization experiments.

- justification for sample style, power analysis
<!-- We didn't do a power analysis during planning, should be do one now? -->
- statistical tests, how do we control for multiple comparisons?
- encouraged to report all data in histograms, scatter plots etc.
- where can the data be accessed?

# Code/Software
- statement about code central to the conclusions in section headed "Code Accessibility"
- when possible use research resource identifiers (RRIDs) and URLs to specifiy software packages etc.

# Results
<!-- Should we organize results by kind of data / analysis (e.g. behavior, decoding etc.) or by experiment? I think kind of data/analysis makes more sense because otherwise we would have a really short section for Experiment I and really long section for Experiment II -->

## Behavior
We quantiﬁed each subject’s localization accuracy as elevation gain (EG), which is the slope of the regression between the actual and perceived sound source elevation [@hofman1998]. An EG of 1 indicates perfect localization (discounting symmetric deviations around the mean), while an EG of 0 indicates that the subject responded randomly. The initial localization tests showed that subjects could determine the sounds' elevation accurately, indicated by an EG of $X$ in experiment I and an EG of $Y$ in experiment II (note that the responses where obtained with a different method in both experiments). While the EGs we observed are lower compared to previous reports on free field sound localization [@makous1990, hofman1998], this is likely due to the much shorter training that subjects received in our study.
